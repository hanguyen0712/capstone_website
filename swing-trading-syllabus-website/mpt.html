        <p>What is diversification?
It is not wise to invest a significant proportion of capital in any single ticker, industry, or even clusters of related industries due to systemic risk (explained in the basic concept section). Classical financial theories state that we can diversify away this risk by investing in multiple unrelated, or even negatively correlated, industries. By doing so, external shocks that send one stock plunging will send its negatively correlated stock soaring. For example, oil stock price tends to dip when airline stock prices gain (explained in the correlation section). If a trader invests in both stocks, their portfolio should not suffer too much loss in the case of a systemic shock to either industry.</p>       
<p>Now that we understand the importance of diversification in reducing risk, how should we diversify our portfolio? This section introduces Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory (MPT), which states that with every risk tolerance level and every portfolio, there is an optimal way to allocate capital to maximize the portfolio’s total expected return. 
I used a toy portfolio that invests $10,000 in Google (GOOG), Zoom (ZM), SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) to illustrate my points in this section. These stocks are chosen because they are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with one another (as shown in the correlation matrix below), which fits what we just discussed in the diversification section above.</p>
<p>With Markowitz’s MPT, we can calculate the optimal portfolio allocation for a particular risk aversion level. Suppose we are extremely risk-averse and penalize any future volatility heavily. You should thus invest heavily in gold and Google while going easy on the other stocks. This allocation makes sense because gold is long considered a ‘stable’ asset, and Google is a large conglomerate that is unlikely to suffer significant losses under normal market conditions.</p>
<p>The efficient frontier is a line comprising of the optimally allocated portfolios at different risk tolerance levels. Portfolios lying on the efficient frontier generate the highest expected return for their respective level of risk tolerance. The figure below shows the efficient frontier for our five-asset portfolio in red. The blue dots are portfolios with random weight allocations. Notice that none of the blue dots lie above the red line. </p>
<p>William Sharpe, the economist who invented the Sharpe ratio, extended the MPT by introducing a risk-free asset to the portfolio. A risk-free asset is an investment that guarantees a return. For example, if you invest in the U.S. treasury bond, you will certainly receive your returns (unless the U.S. government collapses, which is highly unlikely). He reasons that risk-averse investors might benefit from investing in both risky and risk-free assets because the addition of the latter improves profitability at any risk tolerance level. For example, suppose our risky portfolio is expected to return 10% with a standard deviation (a measurement of volatility) of 0.2. Now, suppose we also want to buy the U.S. treasury bond, which yields a 3% return with a standard deviation of 0 (since there is no risk). Suppose we allocate 50% of our capital to the risky portfolio and 50% to the treasury bond. The overall profitability of our new portfolio is: 10% * 0.5 + 3% * 10.5 = 6.5%. Meanwhile, the overall volatility of our new portfolio is: 0.2 * 50% + 0 * 50% = 0.1. The volatility is halved, while the expected return is not compromised quite as much! 
As we adjust the capital allocated to our risk-free asset, the expected returns and standard deviation of our new portfolio also change. The collection of all such portfolios forms the capital allocation line (CAL). The figure below shows that portfolios on the CAL have higher expected returns than those on the efficient frontier and below at the same level of volatility. Investors should always choose these portfolios depending on their risk tolerance level, given their demonstrated superiority.</p>
<p>In conclusion, depending on our risk tolerance level, there is always an optimal way to allocate our portfolio to maximize expected returns and minimize risks. Also, we should consider investing in both risky assets (e.g., stocks) and risk-free ones (e.g., government bonds) to reduce the overall risk of our portfolio.</p>
