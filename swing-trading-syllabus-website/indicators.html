        <p>There are several standardized indicators available to help traders and investors gauge the risk and volatility of the market and their portfolio.
Standard deviation
Standard deviation measures how spread-out data points are around the mean (or the average) of a dataset. The more volatile a stock is, the larger its standard deviation. 
The standard deviation formula of stock A is:
std=i=1nAi-A2n-1
Where:
Ai is the price at time i in our dataset
A is the mean stock price in our dataset
n is the number of data points in our dataset</p>

 <p>Beta measures the volatility of a stock. The market, whose proxy is the S&P500, has a beta of 1. Companies with a beta larger than 1 are more volatile (thus riskier to invest in) than the market. For example, Tesla (TSLA) has a beta of 2.09. This means if the market moves in either direction by 1 unit, TSLA will move in the same direction by 2.09 units. On the contrary, companies with a beta in the range (0, 1) are less volatile than the market (and thus safer to invest in). Companies with a beta of 0 is uncorrelated with the market. Those with a negative beta are negatively correlated with the market. You can calculate a stock’s beta with Excel using this guide.</p>
 <p>Of course, you can calculate beta for a stock portfolio too, given that you know the tickers and the capital distribution of your portfolio. Please note that the longest time period from which you can calculate your portfolio beta is the duration your “newest” stock has been in the market. For example, you cannot calculate the 5-year beta of your portfolio if a stock in it IPO-ed a year ago. The attached Jupyter notebook features a function allowing you to calculate your portfolio beta.</p>
 <p>Alpha measures how much a portfolio underperforms or outperforms a benchmark index after risk adjustments expressed as a percentage. Theoretically, the higher the alpha, the more profitable a portfolio is. A positive alpha means the portfolio is outperforming the benchmark, while a positive alpha means it is underperforming. An alpha of 0 means it performs just as well as the benchmark. 
Its formula is:
α=R-Rf-β(Rm-Rf)
Where:
R is the return of our portfolio
Rf is the risk-free rate of return (explained in the Securities section)
 is the beta explained in the previous section
Rm is the return of our chosen benchmark</p>
<p>R-Squared shows how much variation in one stock can be explained by the variation in another stock or index. It is thus a measurement of the correlation between two stocks or indices. You can calculate R-Squared using the function RSQ() in Excel. 
R-Squared takes a value in the [0, 1] range. A value close to 1 means the movement of one stock can largely be explained by another. A value close to 0 means the movement of the two stocks are uncorrelated. 
The attached Jupyter notebook features an R-Squared calculation function that you can use. Here is a screenshot showing that Microsoft and Apple stocks have an R-Squared of 83% in 2019.

<p>The Sharpe ratio measures the risk-adjusted returns of an investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the investment. As a rule of thumb, good investments tend to have a Sharpe ratio larger than 1. However, this is not always the case. For example, your portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, while other comparable portfolios yield a 1.8 ratio on average, yours might be underperforming. Additionally, you can use the Sharpe ratio to assess how much riskier your portfolio becomes after adding additional securities. 
The formula for the Sharpe ratio is:
Sharpe ratio=R-Rf
Where:
R is the return of our investment
Rf is the risk-free rate of return
 is the standard deviation of our investment’s return
Diversifying your portfolio reduces the unsystematic risk you take, hence increases the Sharpe ratio assuming that the components of your portfolio are kept constant. A limitation of the Sharpe ratio is that it assumes a normal distribution of returns (through the use of standard deviation). This is not always the case. The attached Jupyter notebook features a Sharpe ratio calculation function that you can use.</p>
<p>Bollinger bands consist of two standard deviation lines that are two standard deviations away from a moving average line (Investopedia Staff, 2020). Students unclear about moving averages can visit the technical analysis section to revise. It attempts to capture price volatility under the assumption that random short-term price fluctuations are normally distributed. Hence around 95% of the fluctuations lie within two standard deviations within the mean. The more volatile a stock is, the wider the bands become.
The Bollinger bands are the basis of a popular mean-reversion swing trading strategy introduced in the swing trading strategy section.</p>
<p>VIX is an index measuring implied volatility. It uses options prices for the S&P500 as a proxy for and investors’ sentiment in the next 30 days. VIX is negatively correlated with the market because fear and uncertainty increase when the market shows signs of decline and decrease when it is improving. 
The mathematical formula for VIX is complex, but you do not need to derive it yourself. You can access sites like Yahoo Finance to get real-time VIX.
Most of the time, VIX stays within the [12, 35] range (Kuepper, 2020). A VIX larger than 30 means the market is more volatile than average, while a VIX smaller than 15 means otherwise.
Since VIX is an index, you cannot buy or sell it. However, you can trade options and futures derived from it, such as the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) (Kuepper, 2020).
