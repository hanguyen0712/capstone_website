        What is special about swing trading is that it acknowledges the role of cognitive and emotional biases and attempts to utilize them. For example, when a stock increases in price, it might signal to traders, especially novice ones, that it is trading in an uptrend or that it is a fundamentally good stock. Thus, there might be an opportunity to make a profit if they buy now and sell at a higher price later. This prompts more traders to buy and hold the stock, which increases the demand for that stock in the market, pushing the price higher and continuing the uptrend. It is the case that sometimes, tradersâ€™ sentiments become self-fulfilling prophecies if there are enough traders with the same sentiment.
However, swing traders also fall prey to confirmation bias if they are not careful. Swing trading involves attempting to predict future price movements based on past price performance, volume, and heuristics. As with any other future-prediction task, there is a significant amount of uncertainty involved in the speculation of stock price direction. Thus, it is worth noting that however sophisticated a model is, it is only based on the information and heuristic we know. The market is an inherently chaotic and unpredictable place, and it is crucial that traders arm themselves with as many risk mitigation methods as they can to limit their losses during downturns.
That said, there are three main types of swing trading: chart-based trading, trend (momentum) trading, and mean-reversion trading.
In chart-based trading, traders identify patterns on the stock chart to make their next move. An example of this technique is the Fibonacci retracement method, discussed in the next section. While the technique is straightforward and easy to understand (since it only involves looking at graphs), it is also highly subjective and prone to biases. 
In trend (or momentum) trading, traders assume that their stock of interest trades in trends. Thus, they use measures such as moving averages to identify the current trend and attempt to capitalize on the trend. Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading is an example of this technique. 
In mean reversion trading, traders assume that the stock price reverts around a mean price. Thus, the lower the price gets, the more they buy, in an attempt to cash out when it bounces back to the average. Bollinger band trading is an example of this technique.
