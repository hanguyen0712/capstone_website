        Risk hedging is a risk mitigation method that attempts to reduce potential losses in investment by investing in another negatively correlated with it. A straightforward example of risk hedging is to minimize potential losses when trading oil stocks by also investing in airline stocks. Suppose there is a systemic shock that sends oil price (and thus oil stock price) plunging. In that case, airlines will benefit from cheaper fuels and enjoy better returns (therefore better stock price) if every other macroeconomic factor remains unchanged. The overall portfolio thus should not suffer from too much loss. 
Usually, when talking about hedging in the stock market, we refer to buying derivatives like options along with the underlying stock. As a refresher, an option gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security at a pre-determined price by a pre-determined time. Option buyers need to pay a premium, which is the price of the option. Options act as an ‘insurance for a risky trade.
Suppose an investor wants to long TSLA at $100 a share. However, TSLA is a volatile stock, and they want to minimize the risk of downside as much as possible. In this case, they can also purchase a put option, which gives them the right, but not the obligation, to sell their TSLA shares at $100 a share any time in the next three months. The premium for this option is $20. Thus, if in the next three months, TSLA stock goes up, the investor does not need to exercise the put option – he earns the amount that the stock has gone up minus $20. In the case the stock goes down to, say, $80 per share, he still gets to sell his shares at $100 per share and pays $20 for the premium. Instead of losing ($100 - $80) * (the number of shares sold), he only loses $20.
