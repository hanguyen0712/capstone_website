For example, the Cboe volatility index (VIX) measures market volatility, while the S&amp;P500 represents the performance of 500 largest companies in the U.S. stock exchanges. The S&amp;P500 is not the only stock performance index there is. In the U.S., we also have Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite. Outside of the U.S., each country with a viable stock market has at least one such index. For example, Japan has Nikkei 225, and Vietnam has VN30. Different people might track different indices depending on which market they trade in and which characteristics they want to track. Indices give a broad picture of the groups they represent and act as a benchmark for investors to evaluate the characteristics and returns of their investment. For example, if the annual return of the S&amp;P500 is 20% and your portfolio only yields 3% profit, it is underperforming and might require modifications.&nbsp;</span></p>

You can, however, employ an &ldquo;indexing&rdquo; strategy where you build your portfolio with the same components making up an index.
