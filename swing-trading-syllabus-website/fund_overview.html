        <p>Fundamental analysis attempts to calculate the “true value” (called the fair value) of a company using financial data (e.g., financial statements), an analysis of its leadership and long-term strategies, as well as a consideration for the macroeconomic environment it operates in. As swing traders predominantly focus on capturing short-term and mid-term trends, fundamental analysis is not often used. However, since it is generally more profitable and less risky to trade shares of “good” companies than “junk” ones, students might benefit from learning about fundamental analysis to have a more rigorous evaluation of a company. The goal of fundamental analysis is to thoroughly analyze the performance of a company and the business environment surrounding it to identify its potential for growth and profitability in the future. If a company operates well and has great potential for future growth, but its current stock price does not seem to reflect that, we say that the stock is ‘underpriced.’ Otherwise, if the current stock price seems higher than what the company is worth now or in the future, we say that it is ‘overpriced.’ Typically, investors invest in underpriced stocks in the hope that the company will continue doing well and its stock price will increase to reflect this good performance. 
Fundamental analysis typically relies on a top-down approach, starting with the assessment of the overall health of the economy, moving to the condition of specific industries, and finally evaluating companies within these industries. For example, suppose we are considering an investment in Tesla. The general questions you need to consider are:
What is the current condition of the US economy? Is it a bull or a bear market?
We can answer this question by following the news and paying attention to indices in the market (e.g., the close-to-close percentage change in the S&P500, changes in GDP, unemployment rate). Students can find out more about the characteristics of a bull or a bear market in the Bull vs. bear market section.
What is the current condition of the US automobile industry? Is it flourishing or declining, given the current market condition? 
We can answer this question by following the news and reading papers and reports from official sources. For example, The US Department of Commerce has a report showing the US automotive industry is among the largest globally, has been profitable in consecutive recent years, has a large customer base, and enjoys favorable investment policies (SelectUSA, n.d.). These are signs that the industry is thriving, and investments are likely profitable.
How is Tesla doing?
We can answer this question by analyzing their financial statements, evaluating their management, and following the news to understand their strategies, competitors, and future prospects. Read on to have an overview of how we might do so.
