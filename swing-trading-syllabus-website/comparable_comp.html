        <p>Comparable companies are companies that share some features in common. For example, they can be in the same industries, of the same size, or in the same stage of the corporate life cycle. For example, Toyota and Tesla are comparable companies because they are both automobile manufacturers with product offerings in many countries. Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, Honda, and Volkswagen are also their comparable because they are also international automobile manufacturers. Depending on which aspect of a company you are interested in, the set of comparable companies might differ. For example, if you are interested in Tesla because it is a high-tech company situated in Silicon Valley, its comparable companies might be Microsoft and Apple instead. 
By comparing our company of interest with others that share the same characteristics, we get a broad picture of the performance of that cluster of companies and where our company stands. For example, we have calculated that Tesla’s net margin in 2020 is 2%. Without a benchmark, it is difficult to determine whether 2% is a good or bad margin. We also cannot compare Tesla’s net margin with any other random company (e.g., say, American Airlines) because they are in different industries, and different industries have different average margins. Instead, we need to pick Toyota, which is in the same industry, with roughly the same market valuation, and sell products in roughly the same markets, to compare. The more similar the two companies are, the better the comparison is. By comparing Tesla’s 2% margin with Toyota’s 7%, we know that Tesla is not as profitable as Toyota. To get a picture of how profitable Tesla is compared to the U.S. automotive industry, we need to also calculate the margin of several other companies (e.g., Ford, GM, Volkswagen) and compare Tesla’s margin to their average margin. Professor Aswath Damodaran from New York University maintains several datasets on financial ratios by industry, which you can access free of charge. As of 2020, he is tracking 134 companies in the global car and truck industry to inform his calculations (Damodaran, 2020).
